DRH Core Python Code
This compilation includes the primary classes for Realm, Entity, and ConsciousnessUnit, the enumerations for moral and existential states, and the main simulation engine.
1. Enumerations
These enums define the fundamental states and alignments within the DRH framework.
from enum import Enum, auto

class MoralAlignment(Enum):
   """
   Defines the moral alignment of a consciousness unit.
   This is a spectrum from pure self-interest to universal altruism.
   """
   SYNDRIONIC = "Syndrionic"       # Aligned with universal order, empathy, creation
   ASYNDRIONIC = "Asyndrionic"   # Aligned with chaos, self-interest, entropy
   NEUTRAL = "Neutral"           # Balanced or unaligned
   APATHETIC = "Apathetic"       # Disconnected from the moral spectrum

class ExistentialState(Enum):
   """
   Represents the state of existence for an entity or realm.
   """
   MANIFEST = auto()             # Currently existing and active
   DORMANT = auto()              # Existing but inactive
   POTENTIAL = auto()            # Not yet manifest, exists as a possibility
   NULLIFIED = auto()            # Ceased to exist, returned to the Void

2. Core Classes
These are the foundational building blocks of the DRH simulation.

import random

   Represents a single point of consciousness, which can inhabit an Entity.

       self.karmic_resonance = 0.0   # A measure of the consequences of actions

   def update_resonance(self, action_value: float):
       """Updates karmic resonance based on an action."""
       self.karmic_resonance += action_value
       print(f"Consciousness {self.id}: Resonance updated to {self.karmic_resonance:.2f}")

class Entity:
   """
   A vessel for a ConsciousnessUnit within a specific Realm.
   This can be anything from a simple organism to a complex being or even a concept.

       self.consciousness.update_resonance(action_value)
       return action_value

   A dimensional plane of existence with its own physical and metaphysical laws.

       print(f"Entity '{entity.name}' has manifested in Realm '{self.name}'.")

   def update_stability(self, collective_resonance: float):
       """Updates the realm's stability based on the actions of its inhabitants."""

3. Simulation Engine
This simple engine demonstrates how the classes interact to simulate a cycle within a realm.

       self.realms[realm.id] = realm
       print(f"New Realm '{name}' created with frequency {frequency}.")
       return realm

   def run_cycle(self, realm_id):
       """Runs a single simulation cycle for a specific realm."""
       if realm_id not in self.realms:
           print(f"Error: Realm with ID {realm_id} not found.")
           return

       realm = self.realms[realm_id]
       print(f"\n--- Running cycle for Realm '{realm.name}' ---")

       if not realm.entities:
           print("Realm is empty. No actions to process.")
           return

       total_resonance_change = 0
       for entity in realm.entities:
           total_resonance_change += entity.perform_action()

       # The realm's stability is affected by the sum of all actions
       realm.update_stability(total_resonance_change)
