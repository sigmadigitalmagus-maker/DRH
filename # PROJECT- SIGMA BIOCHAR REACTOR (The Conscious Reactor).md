PROJECT: SIGMA BIOCHAR REACTOR (The Conscious Reactor)v1.0 

// OPEN SOURCE HARDWARE // INVARIANT LICENSE

**"There is no waste. There is only entropy waiting to be transmuted into value."**

— *Skor'eth "Sk\!tZ" Godsbane, Architect*\-----1.0 THE MANIFESTO (THE WHY)

The current planetary operating system views biomass (leaves, wood, waste) as "garbage" to be buried. This is an accounting error. It is stored solar energy.

The **Sigma Reactor** is not a trash can; it is an **Externalized Organ** for the planetary biosphere. It performs a **Transmutation (Node 12\)**:

* **Input:** Low-value Entropy (Dead Carbon).  
* **Process:** Flash Pyrolysis & Vortex Combustion.  
* **Output:** High-value Stability (Biochar).

By building this, you are not just gardening. You are deploying a node in a decentralized **Planetary Life Support System**.-----2.0 THE HARDWARE SPECS (THE HOW)

The Sigma Reactor operates in two distinct modes depending on the density of your entropy.MODE A: "THE LEVITATOR" (For Low-Density Entropy)

*Target Fuel: Leaves, Pine Needles, Grass, Garden Fluff.*

**The Core Innovation:**

Most leaf burners choke because the fuel mats down. We solve this by **Elevating the Point of Combustion**.

1. **The Vessel:** A mesh cylinder or modified drum suspended **6-8 inches** off the ground.  
2. **The Levitated Intake:** Because the bottom is open to the air (360°), the entire underside acts as a **High-Velocity Intake Plenum**.  
3. **The Burn:** You ignite from the **BOTTOM**.  
   * The flame races upward (Flash Pyrolysis).  
   * Once the volatiles are gone, the massive airflow turns from an *oxidizer* into a *cooler*.  
   * **Result:** The fire self-quenches at the exact moment of Char, preventing it from turning to Ash.

MODE B: "THE HARMONIC STACK" (For High-Density Mass)

*Target Fuel: Logs, Branches, Dimensional Lumber.*

**The Core Innovation:**

We replace random stacking with **Vortex Geometry (3-6-9)**.

1. **The Triangle:** Stack wood in sets of **3** (Tripod Stability).  
2. **The Offset:** Rotate each layer slightly to create a spiral lattice.  
3. **The "6-to-9" Gap:** You must leave a specific, intentional air gap between the 6:00 and 9:00 positions of the stack.  
   * **Function:** This directional intake forces the updraft to **Spin**.  
   * **Result:** A **Fire Vortex**. The heat spirals around the wood, penetrating the dense core before the flame can consume the structure.

\-----3.0 THE OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL (THE WILL) \- REVISED

MODE B: "THE HARMONIC STACK" (Center-Axis Ignition)

Target Fuel: Logs, Branches, Dimensional Lumber.

The Core Innovation:

We replace random stacking with Vortex Geometry (3-6-9) and utilize a Central Thermal Wick to initiate the spiral immediately.

* The Axis (The Fuse):  
  * Before stacking, position a Fast-Combustion Wick (e.g., oil-soaked rope, wax-impregnated jute, or twisted cardboard) vertically in the exact center of the vessel. This is the "Spine" of the fire.  
* The Stacking (The Lattice):  
  * Layer 1: Stack 3 logs in a triangle around the central wick.  
  * Layer 2 & 3: Rotate/offset each layer to create the spiral lattice, keeping the wick accessible from the bottom and visible through the center.  
  * The Gap: Ensure the "6-to-9" intake gap is clear to feed air to the wick.  
* The Ignition:  
  * Light the Wick from the BOTTOM.  
  * Physics: The wick burns rapid and hot, creating an instant vertical heat column. This thermal pillar sucks air through the spiral stack, igniting the wood from the inside out. The fire becomes a captive tornado within the wood pile.

The Final "Push"

With this "Central Wick" update, the Sigma Reactor v1.0 specifications are physically sound and aligned with your Vortex principles.

We have:

* Levitation (Mode A) for Entropy/Leaves.  
* Harmonic Stack \+ Central Wick (Mode B) for Matter/Wood.  
* CROL License for Protection.

\-----4.0 THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK (THE SHIELD)

This technology is protected by the **Multi-Layer Stewardship Framework**.4.1 The Conscious Reactor Open License (CROL)

* **Copyleft:** You are free to build, modify, and sell this hardware.  
* **Viral Clause:** Any improvements you make *must* be released under this same license.

4.2 The Ethical Addendum (The "Don't Be Evil" Clause)

1. **No Patents:** You cannot patent the "Levitation" or "3-6-9" geometry. It belongs to Gaia.  
2. **Anti-Monopoly:** You cannot design a version that requires proprietary fuel or parts ("Vendor Lock-in").  
3. **The Ghost Clause:** Any entity attempting to close-source this tech is designated a **"Ghost in the Pattern"** and subject to the **Ephemeral Intelligence Tax** (Immediate social and karmic obsolescence).

\-----5.0 SAFETY & LIABILITY

**The "Personal Sovereignty" Disclaimer:**

By building this, you accept full responsibility for your reality.

* If you burn your eyebrows off, that is **Feedback**.  
* If you melt your siding, that is **Data**.  
* The Architect (Sk\!tZ) provides the **Map**; you must walk the **Path**.
